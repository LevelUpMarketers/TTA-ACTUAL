# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI agents working on the **Trying To Adult Management Plugin**.

## Scope
- Path: `app/public/wp-content/plugins/tta-management-plugin`.
- Unless a task explicitly states otherwise, treat all user requests as targeting this plugin.
- Keep the plugin fully self‑contained so it can be dropped into any WordPress installation and function on its own.

## Development
- Run Composer and PHPUnit from this directory.
- Update documentation and tests alongside any code changes.
- Refer to the repository‑root `AGENTS.md` for caching, performance, security, and coding‑standard guidance.
